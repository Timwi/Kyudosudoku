  "news2_1": "Hello everyone! I’m proud to announce the following changes and enhancements.",
  "news2_2": "We have a new variety constraint: the Skyscraper Sum! Check out the constraints page or dive right in and find a puzzle.",
  "news2_3": "I remade the graphics for the Skyscraper clue. The old one frankly looked like a blocky candle.",
  "news2_4": "The constraint that was previously called “Capped Line” is now called “Between Line” which is what it is generally called in the world of variety Sudoku. The graphics have also been updated to look like their usual representation (two circles connected by a line).",
  "news2_5": "The Palindrome constraint has been changed to look the way that Capped Line used to. Its double-struck line looking like an equals sign, and its two arrows pointing in opposite directions, seem to fit the idea of a palindrome much better.",
  "news2_6": "The front page will now always offer one random puzzle with no variety constraints. Hopefully this provides an easier intro to new players.",
  "news2_7": "Enjoy!",
  "news3": "Two new constraints: German Whisper and Means",
  "news3_1": "We have introduced two new variety Sudoku constraints!",
  "news3_2": "The German Whisper line may well be familiar to seasoned Sudoku solvers. Simply keep adjacent digits at a difference of at least 5! Sounds simple, but can give rise to deceptively intricate deductions.",
  "news3_3": "The Means constraint is a novel idea. It regulates how many of the digits surrounding a cell can cause the constrained cell to be their arithmetic mean ((a+b)/2) or geometric mean (√(ab)). Something for the maths enthusiasts!",
  "news3_4": "To try out these new constraints, check out puzzles #3034 and #3045.",

  "rulesOfKyudosudoku": "Rules of Kyudosudoku",
  "rules1": "Kyudosudoku is a logic puzzle that combines Kyudoku with variety Sudoku.",
  "rules2": "Each puzzle consists of four 6×6 grids filled with digits 1–9 — <cite>the Kyudoku grids</cite> — and a blank 9×9 grid, the <cite>Sudoku grid</cite>, often with some extra graphics in or around it.",
  "kyudokuRules": "The Kyudoku part",
  "kyudokuRules1": "In each Kyudoku grid, exactly one of each digit 1–9 must be circled in such a way that the circled digits in each row or column never add up to more than 9.",
  "kyudokuInvalid1": "Invalid: two 2’s are circled.",
  "kyudokuInvalid2": "Invalid: none of the 4’s are circled.",
  "kyudokuInvalid3": "Invalid: the last column has 2 and 8 circled, which add up to 10, which is more than 9.",
  "kyudokuValid": "Valid example.",
  "sudokuRules": "The Sudoku part",
  "sudokuRules1": "The Sudoku grid must be filled with digits 1–9 in such a way that every row, every column and every outlined 3×3 box contains the digits 1–9 exactly once.",
  "sudokuRules2": "Furthermore, each Kyudoku grid is linked with a 6×6 “corner” of the Sudoku grid (the coloring helps to visualize this). Every circled digit in a Kyudoku grid transfers that digit to the equivalent location on the Sudoku grid, as shown below:",
  "sudokuRules3": "Note that the same is not true in reverse. If a digit you place in the Sudoku matches the corresponding digit in a Kyudoku grid, it does not necessarily follow that the digit must be circled. Similarly, a crossed-out digit in a Kyudoku grid does not necessarily imply that the corresponding Sudoku cell can’t have that digit in it.",
  "sudokuRules4": "Each Kyudoku grid in isolation may not have a unique solution, but there is only one way to solve the entire puzzle.",
  "constraintsRules": "Variety Sudoku constraints",
  "constraintsRules1": "Each puzzle may have additional graphics in or around the Sudoku grid, which represent additional constraints that must be followed in order to arrive at the correct solution.",

  "commonStratsDesc": "To get started, here are some common deductions that can help you get started on a Kyudosudoku puzzle:",
  "commonStrats1": "There is only a single 6 in this Kyudoku grid, so it must be circled.",
  "commonStrats2": "All values in the same row or column that would bring the sum above 9 can now be crossed out.",
  "commonStrats3": "All of the 1’s in the grid are in a row or column with the highlighted 9. This means the 9 can be crossed out because circling it would rule out all of the 1’s.",
  "commonStrats4": "All of the remaining 9’s are in the same column. No matter which one ends up getting circled, the other digits in the same column would bring the column’s sum above 9, so they can all be crossed out.",
  "commonStrats5": "Remember that the 6 we circled is transferred to the Sudoku grid. Any 6 in the other Kyudoku grids can be crossed out if it would place another 6 within the same row, column, or 3×3 box of the Sudoku grid.",
  "commonStrats6": "Similarly, this 8 can be crossed out because we now know that the corresponding Sudoku cell is already a 6.",
  "commonStrats7": "However, these 6’s cannot be crossed out (nor circled) as they correspond to the exact same cell in the Sudoku grid. Transferring the same digit into the same Sudoku cell multiple times is allowed.",
